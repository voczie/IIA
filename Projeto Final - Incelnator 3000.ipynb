Os filmes de incel se tornaram recentemente uma \"piada interna\" na web e por isso escolhemos minunciosamente os roteiros de algumas dessas obras cinematográficas para afinar um modelo GPT-2, para que seja possível reproduzir mais dessas pérolas do cinema.\n","\n","## Afinal, o que é um Incel?\n","Incel é uma sigla para *involuntary celibatary* (celibatário involuntário). Estas pessoas se denominam parte desse grupo aqueles que não conseguem, por culpa deles ou não, se relacionar romanticamente com nenhuma mulher. Como a maioria dos integrantes são realmente pessoas insuportáveis, rapidamente os incels se tornaram uma \"facção\" **odiada** na Internet. Há vários *memes* sobre incels que podem ser encontrados ao navegar pela web.\n","\n","## O que define um \"filme de incel\"\n","Agora que sabemos o que é um incel, é possível analisar que um bocado dos filmes escolhidos para este projeto não possuem personagens, protagonistas ou não, que se encaixem na definição de incel. Isto se dá porque algumas dessas obras cinematográficas são **as favoritas deste grupo**, já que muitos dos rapazes incels se espelham ou acham que são parecidos com os protagonistas desses filmes.\n","\n","## Os filmes utilizados no treinamento\n","*   (500) Dias com Ela (2009)\n","*   Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas (2008)\n","*   Blade Runner - O Caçador de Androides (1982)\n","*

The TV lights off like an LIGHT WATER.....MOVING ON CABBINE (VANNER DENT.) But before Wallace watches back downstairs - KITCHEN OF HIS LIFE is HOLDEN ON THAT PLACE IN VIEWE: A TURNING CROWD STREET WITH BLACKED WHITE FAME UP FROM BETSY BLAST. SCOTT MOVES INTO CAMERA - WHAM MOMENTS SLAPPS. His face is SACELY redrawn after long white hairline over his arms, eyes fixed firmly into BATMAN GRAVIOUSLY CHIRPS AGAINST PALANTIO TOMAKA STANDERS. He looks sad when MICHAEL has only begun shouting; BRETT'S HEAD SHIPS BACK TO SEAT. We HEAR ANOTHER PERSON (to Michael�s surprise), then enters this room now dressed differently than we had even seen BEFORE. There are two other people waiting inside except Bateman who makes motions towards Scott holding down Batman gasps--(bouta pause). She reaches across Joker carrying some food, water bottle baggie wrapped around himself or something else close behind them ---with batman sitting next door. At first glance they look suspiciously familiar once more. As Mr RAMONE gets near Freddy Gordon takes part? They're talking loud. EXTEGRATED PRESS/ PHILIPOTHIC EXPRESSIVES APARTMENT ECHO PARKING DRIVER ROOM #6 No longer standing outside PAULIE & MCKENZI ROOFTOP FOREST NIGHT AND MORNING From 1945 until 1970 Tom Wayne waits calmly beside Patrick Blanchey in front of Connie White House Office Building. Inside however many cameras have been kept locked open for the whole evening. In fact there may never be any daylight. Even without police escort Tommy goes inside too soon because Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt says no. He thinks nothing about answering Jerry Lee Greene all night long until Joe speaks again to Dimona Lewis Murray Brownstein where Jack tries another move immediately rather quickly following Andy Driver away. Suddenly Kitty smiles slowly.\n","\n","��士CUT TO: 2 INT ENGLISH FILMS:\n","\n","Theodore sees Bonnie walking into Charles Franklin Square Park early morning as Knives approaches. Her legs come out of nowhere having fallen, disappearing, unable make contact while Penny walks through security windows alone toward Vincent Raymond Langford Jr., wearing glasses made totally black. Thomas holds Tyler Pink Floyd hat on Travis chest, then walks briskly between Gideon Bergnard Young and Marvin Bartender instead leaving Charlie Dent staring directly at Todd Thurston McKenzie. Teddy comes up dead. Owen picks up Wendy Davis playing cards at Eddie Adams's desk. Then Elizabeth Fisher shakes hands nervously and turns Randall Paulingian forward watching Rupert take hold against Frank Marsellus right next frame ahead Lance Levelles pacing along Broadway.
